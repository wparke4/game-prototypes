        <ol class="ol2">
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Consent to Jurisdiction in New York, NY.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>The exclusive jurisdiction and venue for proceedings involving any and all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the breach thereof, or any use of the Site (including all commercial transactions) (&quot;Claims&quot;) shall be the courts of competent jurisdiction sitting within New York County, NY (the &quot;Forum&quot;), and the parties hereby waive any argument that any such court does not have personal jurisdiction or that the Forum is not appropriate or convenient; (b) you waive any and all rights to trial by jury with respect to any Claims.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If either party initiates a proceeding involving a Claim under this Section other than in the Forum, the other party shall recover all attorneys&apos; fees and expenses reasonably incurred in enforcing this Agreement and the Forum to which the parties have herein agreed.</span></li>
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>General Disputes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>Should you encounter an issue with our service, the rulings of which are not set forth in these Terms or Rules of Contest, you may submit a Dispute via ticket in the Internet Game Discord server.</span></li>
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Arbitration.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>If You and We were not able to resolve the dispute via informal conversation, You agree to resolve all claims before a neutral arbitrator.</span></li>
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor we will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. If this waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a Dispute, then it won&rsquo;t apply to those parts. Instead, those parts will be severed and proceed in a court of law, with the remaining parts proceeding in arbitration.</span></li>
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Arbitration procedure</strong>. If you are located within the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom or the European Union, or any of their territories, then any arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the &ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. You and we each agree to commence arbitration only in New York, NY USA. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the AAA rules. In a Dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. If you are located in a country other than listed above, then arbitration will be conducted by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) pursuant to UNCITRAL rules, and the arbitration shall be conducted in English and the English version of these Terms (and not any translation) shall control, and both parties hereby agree to accord this arbitration agreement the broadest scope admissible under applicable Laws, and that it shall be interpreted in a non-restrictive manner. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. These Terms govern to the extent they conflict with the arbitrators&rsquo; commercial rules. The arbitrator may award compensatory damages but shall NOT be authorized to award non-economic damages, such as for emotional distress, or pain and suffering or punitive or indirect, incidental or consequential damages. Each party shall bear its own attorneys&rsquo; fees, cost and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the arbitrator and AAA; however, the arbitrator may award to the prevailing party reimbursement of its reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs (including, for example, expert witness fees and travel expenses), and/or the fees and costs of the arbitrator. Within fifteen (15) calendar days after conclusion of the arbitration, the arbitrator shall issue a written award and a written statement of decision describing the material factual findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. Judgment on the award may be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties waive their right to commence any action or judicial proceeding in connection with a dispute hereunder, except for purposes of: (i) recognition and/or enforcement of the arbitration award or any other decision by the arbitral tribunal, (ii) obliging the other party to participate in the arbitration proceedings, (iii) requesting any type of conservative or interim measure in connection with the dispute prior to the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, (iv) requesting the appearance of witnesses and/or experts, and/or (v) requesting that any information and/or documentation discovery be complied with. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, you understand that you are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a claim or Dispute were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, the right bring a claim as a class member in any purported class or representative proceeding, and the right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence.</span></li>
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Term to File</strong>. Must be filed within one year. To the extent permitted by applicable law, any claim or Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one year from the date of the cause of action. If a claim or dispute isn&rsquo;t filed within one year, it&rsquo;s permanently barred.</span></li>
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Equitable Relief</strong>. You agree that we would be irreparably damaged if these Terms were not specifically enforced. Therefore, in addition to any other remedy we may have at law, and notwithstanding our agreement to arbitrate Disputes, we are entitled without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to seek appropriate equitable remedies with respect to your violation of these Terms in any court of competent jurisdiction.</span></li>
            <li class="li5"><span class="s1"><strong>Language of the Terms</strong>: If we provide a translated version of these Terms, the Internet Game Privacy Policy, or any other terms or policy, it is for informational purposes only. If the translated version means something different than the English version, then the English meaning will be the one that applies.</span></li>
